# Event-Search-Ticketmaster
Developed a web application that allows you to search for event information using the Ticketmaster API, and the results will be displayed in a card in tabular format. The application will also allow users to mark events as “Favorites” and see the list of all events marked as favorites. Also, users can share a post on Facebook and a tweet on Twitter
